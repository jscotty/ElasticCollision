# ElasticCollision
ElasticCollision with multiple balls in Java


We had made an elastic collision with two balls in Action Script 3.0 in math class. During summer break I tried to remake this but now using Java! 
I made this elastic collision after researching all about it.
After everyting, I made some playablility with it. 


Take a look at my libary I used for this project

[JavaGameOperator] (https://github.com/jscotty/JavaGameOperator)


Take a look at these codes:

collision with 2 balls
[CollisionEqualsMass] (https://github.com/jscotty/ElasticCollision/blob/master/src/my/math/main/CollisionEqualMass.java)

Vector operations i used for calculations from my libary.
